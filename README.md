# _Tabletop RPG Reincarnation Generator_

_Description:_

This program simulates the rolling of a die in determining the reincarnation of a character in a given Tabletop RPG.
Using pre-existing reincarnation tables as a reference, it will display the race that the deceased character will reincarnate as in their campaign.


_TODO:_
  * Add choice to roll for D&D 5th Edition Reincarnation Table
  * More to come
